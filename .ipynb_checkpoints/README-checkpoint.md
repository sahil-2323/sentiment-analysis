# Twitter Sentiment Analysis System

A machine learning–based Sentiment Analysis system that classifies tweets into Positive, Negative, or Neutral sentiments using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Logistic Regression. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment using Streamlit.

## Project Overview

Social media platforms like Twitter generate massive amounts of unstructured text data. This project analyzes tweet sentiment to help understand public opinion, customer feedback, and social trends.

The model is trained on a real-world Twitter dataset containing tweet text and sentiment labels.

## Key Features
